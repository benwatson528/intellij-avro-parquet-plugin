# IntelliJ Avro Plugin

A Tool Window plugin for IntelliJ that displays Avro `.avro` files in human-readable JSON format.

Features include:
 - Foldable schema viewing
 - Table or plaintext viewing of records
 - Selectable number of records to show
 - Simple drag-and-drop interface

## Installing
Following https://blog.jetbrains.com/platform/2018/05/legal-news-plugin-license-is-required-for-all-plugins/, it is not
possible for me to upload this plugin to the JetBrains plugin repo. As such installation is manual. 

1. [Download the plugin](http://whatever.com).
2. In IntelliJ, go to `File -> Settings -> Plugins -> click the cog -> Install Plugin from Disk` and select the downloaded zip.
3. After a restart, an `Avro Viewer` Tool Window should be visible at the bottom of IntelliJ.
